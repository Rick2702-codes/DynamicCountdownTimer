# DynamicCountdownTimer
An user-friendly, smooth and responsive countdown timer that displays the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds until a user-defined end time. It automatically takes the moment of clicking "Start" as the timer’s starting point, and I've also included a dynamic progress bar that visually tracks the countdown’s progress.
